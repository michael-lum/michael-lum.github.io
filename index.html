					<h3 class="dec">LA Trip</h3>
					<p>Los Angeles was my first trip during Winter Break with my friends.  It was very spontaneous and I didn't decide to go until a couple days before.  This was to cure some of the seperation anxiety for my friends in college, who I would not see for a whole 2 weeks.  For this 5 day trip, we ate tons, took lots of pictures, and visited many beaches.  </p>

					<p>Before I visited Los Angeles, I hadn’t heard very good things about LA. I was told the traffic is a nightmare and that everyone there is superficial, among many other not-so-good things, and I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the city. But once I was there, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I LOVED Los Angeles.</p>
