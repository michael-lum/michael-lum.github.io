	<i>Computer Science Major | 2nd Year</i>

	<p>Greetings! I am a second year CS major and music minor at UC Berkeley. In my free time, I like to fiddle around on different instruments, milly rock, hang out with my fellowship, and waste away watching Planet Earth. I like cooking chicken and broccoli in various different fashions.</p>
